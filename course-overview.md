# Beginning Ruby on Rails

An 8-week course covering Ruby on Rails 3 by Anthony Lewis

The first session will start with installing the development 
environment and an overview of tools used by Rails developers.
Next a sample application will be created and explored to 
demonstrate the Rails MVC architecture.

The next three sessions will cover the three main components of
every Rails application:  Model, View, and Controller.  Each
component will be described in detail as we add features to
the sample application.

Session five will cover application testing and test driven
development.  We will create a new application from scratch
using test driven development.

Session six will cover more advanced Rails features such as
User Sessions and unobtrusive Javascript.  We will use these
to add additional features to our new application.  We will
also discuss debugging.

Session seven will provide an overview of many popular gems
used in Rails applications.  We will add authentication, 
authorization, pagination, and easy file uploads to the
application.

Session eight will wrap up the series by covering application
security and deployment.  We will first use git to deploy the
application to Heroku and then use Capistrano to deploy
to any host.  We will also cover performance monitoring and
testing of Rails applications.
